Transcript & Certificate System Fix – Required Updates (Clear Developer Specification)
1. Apply the correct official header on the Transcript

Replace the current transcript header with the exact official header shown in the file G6TR-2025-010743.pdf (page 1) 

G6TR-2025-010743

:

Arabic (right side):

الأمانة العامة للتعليم الإسلامي العربي
في غامبيا
قسم الامتحانات

English (left side):

The General Secretariat for
Islamic/Arabic Education in
The Gambia
Examination Affairs Unit

This header must be displayed exactly as in the sample transcript, including spacing and formatting.

2. Fix Transcript Table Layout (must match the official format)

The layout must follow the exact order shown in the transcript sample:
(See subject table on page 1 of the sample PDF) 

G6TR-2025-010743

Correct table column order (from RIGHT → LEFT):

م (Serial number)

المادة (Subject name)

الدرجات الكبرى (Maximum mark)

الدرجات الصغرى (Minimum mark)

الدرجة المكتسبة رقماً (Actual mark)

The current system displays these columns in the wrong order.
You must correct this to match the sample transcript.

3. Certificate is not displaying – must fix immediately

There is a system issue where:

Certificates do not show

Some eligible students cannot generate a certificate

Generated certificates cannot be downloaded

You must fix the certificate module so that:

✓ Eligible students appear in the list
✓ Certificates generate successfully
✓ Every generated certificate can be viewed and downloaded
✓ No blank or broken certificates

The logic must match the transcript and certificate integration described earlier.

4. Add “View” icon (Preview) for both Transcript & Certificate

Like the sample transcript and certificate, add a View (eye) icon next to each generated document:

View Transcript

View Certificate

This allows the admin to preview the PDF before printing or downloading.

5. Add “Print All” button for both Transcript & Certificate

Add:

Print All Transcripts

Print All Certificates

These must open all generated PDFs in a combined, printable window.

6. Fix why Transcript & Certificate are not showing

You must investigate and resolve all issues causing:

Transcript page not showing

Certificate page not showing

Students not loading

Templates not loading

Missing assets or mismatched routing

Everything must work perfectly and smoothly.

7. Make this implementation complete and correct

Please complete the entire fix properly.
This needs to be fully functional, as we have limited developer credits and cannot repeat corrections.
