1. Functionalities of the Examination Center

Based on the BRD, an Examination Center has multiple built-in functions. Here is a structured breakdown:

A. Timetable Display & Management

The center dashboard shows all subjects, dates, and times for the exams allocated to that particular center.
→ "Center dashboards show timetable, timers, attendance, malpractice."

B. Attendance Tracking

Center Admin uses the system to mark student attendance using:

Index number

Barcode on exam card

Printed attendance sheets

Attendance records are automatically logged into the central system.

C. Malpractice Reporting

Centers can submit realtime reports of exam malpractice:

Cheating

Smuggling of notes

Misconduct

Teacher interference

These are timestamped and sent directly to System Admin for action.

D. Logistics Management at Center Level

Centers track:

What question papers they received

When they were received

Storage logs

Paper distribution to classrooms

Return of scripts after exams

→ "Track movement of exam papers: dispatched, received, stored, distributed. Timestamped events, staff accountability, security alerts."

E. Examiner Coordination (if applicable)

Some centers also handle:

Examiner attendance

Script handover after exam

Reporting allowances

F. Student Information Access

Students and parents can see:

Assigned center

Timetable

Exam card

→ "View center, timetable, exam card, results."

✅ 2. How Admin Should Assign Schools to Examination Centers

This is an important workflow because Amaanah conducts exams for 400 schools nationwide.

Below is a step-by-step plan based on the BRD plus professional examination-management best practices.

A. Admin First Creates Exam Year & Centers

From the system admin panel:

Create new Exam Year

Create or import Examination Centers

Define capacity for each center (optional but recommended)

→ "Create exam year, assign schools to centers."

B. What Data Helps the Admin in Assignment?

Schools already have:

Region

Cluster

School type (LBS/UBS/BCS/SSS)

Student population

→ "School completes profile: address, region, cluster, type..."

This allows the system to group schools by:

Nearest center

Region

Education type (for timetable alignment)

C. Assignment Methods (Two Options)
1. Automatic Assignment (Recommended)

The system checks all schools and assigns them to centers using rules:

Rules for Auto-Assignment

Schools within the same region/cluster should be placed in the same center.

Prevent overloading of center capacity (if defined).

If student population is large, split them across two adjacent centers (for fairness).

Priority to nearest center based on address.

Admin Workflow for Auto-Assignment:

Admin clicks "Assign Schools to Centers"

System runs allocation algorithm

Admin reviews suggested assignments

Admin approves or adjusts manually

This reduces workload for 400+ schools.

2. Manual Assignment (When Needed)

Admin may manually place a school into a center if:

The school is in a remote location

Center is newly added

Special cases (girls-only, boys-only, cluster exam)

Avoid overcrowding

Manual Workflow:

Go to Examination Management → Centers

Select a center

Click “Add School to This Center”

Choose a school from dropdown

Save assignment

✅ 3. Important Logic for Assignment

To avoid operational problems, your system should apply the following logic:

Logic 1: Distance-Based Allocation

If possible, integrate Google Maps or region mapping.

Logic 2: Capacity Check

Example:

A center with 300 seats cannot take a school with 450 students.
The system should show a warning:
"Center capacity exceeded."

Logic 3: Grade-Level Separation

Some centers may take only:

Grades 3 & 6

Or Grades 9 & 12

Admin should choose grade availability per center.

Logic 4: Cluster Priority

A cluster should ideally share the same center.

Logic 5: Special Requests

Admin should have a feature to override rules for special circumstances.

✅ 4. What Happens After Assignment?
✔ Schools see their center immediately

Via School Admin dashboard.

✔ Students/Parents see center in their portal

→ "View center... exam card"

✔ Exam Cards automatically display the assigned center

With barcode and index number.
