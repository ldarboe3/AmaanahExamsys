Please fix the certificate generation system so that it produces the exact same design as the official certificates Lamin will upload.

The current system tries to recreate the design using HTML/CSS, but that approach can never match the real certificate because the official template has:

a detailed security-pattern background

a unique border frame

exact spacing and typography

specific Arabic formatting

high-resolution print design

This means the system must stop trying to build the certificate layout from scratch, and instead use the official certificate image as the background, then place text on top of it.

📌 What You Must Do
1. Use the original certificate design as a background image

Lamin will upload two certificates (Primary & Secondary).

These images must be used as the full background of the generated certificate.

This is the only way to match the exact design.

2. Overlay the student information on top

You will place the text in specific positions above the background, including:

Student Name

Date of Birth

Place of Birth

School Name

Address

Academic Year

Final Result

Certificate Number

Islamic Date

Gregorian Date

Signatures

The goal is for the text to appear in the exact right location on the template.

3. Use proper Arabic rendering

The certificate has Arabic text, so you must ensure:

The text is right-to-left

An Arabic font is used (such as Amiri or Noto Naskh)

Spacing and shaping follow real Arabic formatting

Without proper Arabic settings, the text will not look like the original.

4. Output a high-quality, print-ready PDF

Use the background image at full resolution

Create the PDF at 300 DPI

No white borders or scaling

Must look exactly like a professionally printed certificate

5. Make a separate settings file for text positions

The positions of the text fields should be stored in a simple configuration file (or JSON).
This makes it easy to adjust the text alignment without editing the main system.

6. There will be two templates

Gambia Madrassah Primary Certificate

Gambia Madrassah Secondary Certificate

The system should choose the correct background based on the student’s level.

🎯 Expected Result

When a certificate is generated:

It should look exactly like the government-approved certificate Lamin uploaded.

No differences in borders, patterns, spacing, or colors.

Only the dynamic text changes.

The final PDF must be clean, sharp, and ready for printing.
