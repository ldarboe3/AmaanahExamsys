System Update Request — Summary of Required Fixes & Enhancements

Please implement the following updates and improvements across the platform:

1. Automatic Index Number Generation

Currently, certificate generation fails because some students do not have index numbers.

Required Fix:

When a student is approved—whether from Result Upload or Student Upload—the system should automatically generate a 6-digit random index number.

This must apply immediately once the student’s status changes to Approved.

2. School List Enhancements

Add the following actions to the School List page:

Send View Credentials

Send Verification Email

Also:

Fix the Export button so it works on the same page without redirecting.

3. Student List Page Updates
For Super Admin:

Remove the countdown timer from the Student List page.

For Schools:

Remove the timer on the student registration page once payment is successfully submitted.

If payment is approved, display a confirmation message instead of the timer.

If payment is rejected, the timer should reappear.

Performance by Region → Convert to Pie Chart.

Performance by Grade → Add filters:
